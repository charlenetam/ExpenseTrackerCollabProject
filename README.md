Reflection:
One of the biggest difficulties was determining who was to do which part. Since many functions depended on each other, we had to wait for one to be completed before the other could be accomplished. This slowed down the teamwork more than expected. Attempting to decipher each other's coding rationale also made it more difficult at times, leading to debugging issues and coding style consistency. To get past these issues, we enhanced communication through the discussion of function structures. Although this lessened confusion, the interdependence of various parts continued to make the process more complex than if we were working alone.

To be honest, we did not have as much fun coding together as we had hoped. The need to read each other's code and try to work with it slowed the process down and made it more difficult. While it was a great learning experience in the aspect of teamwork and debugging, in this case, it might have been easier to work individually. With that said, we now have a greater appreciation for the pitfalls of group coding assignments and how to structure them more effectively in the future.
